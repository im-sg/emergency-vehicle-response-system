# emergency-vehicle-response-system
Emergency vehicle response system is a Chat bot that helps a customer when his vehicle breaks down. The Bot evaluates the conditions and responses by giving the possible solution, the charges for repair and the details of the service person to contact like his location and contact number.


Chatbot and AI are ruling the world. Everyone wants them and they are the new intelligent beings. The ChatBot are basically of 2 types- Ruled Based and Generic ChatBot. The ChatBots that are the best in the market, are basically a combination of ruled-based and AI. The ChatBot that we created is basically a small module that would be helpful in our main project. The XARVIS ChatBot is an AI ChatBot. XARVIS is implemented using NLP. The main motive behind this project is that whenever your vehicle breaks down, you have to open Google or any other browsers and search for “mechanics near and all for help”. There is one part i.e, hardware called Raspberry Pi pre installed in your vehicle, whenever your vehicle breaks down it will detect that before itself and our chatbot will opens and come to your rescue. 

                  The ChatBot opens, we have 2 different options here - “HELP” for emergency. In this case, your location would be sent to police and hospital to reach out for your rescue. The other option is “search for” or “open”.Whenever our chatbot open it recognizes whatever you said and it searches for that and results will be displayed to you and you can also open search for facebook, google or whatever you want by saying that preceding by  Search for. It will shows result in your default browser.

                         This is achieved by NLP of Machine Learning and ANN of Deep Learning.
